🛠  Custom  HTTPS  Request  Tool  with  TLS  
Fingerprint
 
Spoofing
 
and
 
Anti-Bot
 
Evasion
 
🎯  Objective  
Build  a  minimal  yet  robust  Go-based  tool  that  performs  HTTPS  requests  designed  to  bypass  
sophisticated
 
anti-bot
 
protections
 
(such
 
as
 
Cloudflare,
 
PerimeterX,
 
Akamai)
 
by
 
mimicking
 
legitimate
 
browser
 
behavior
 
across
 
multiple
 
layers:
 
●  Spoof  TLS  fingerprints  (ClientHello)  to  resemble  popular  browsers  like  Chrome,  Firefox,  
or
 
Safari
 
 ●  Mimic  browser  HTTP  headers  consistent  with  the  selected  TLS  profile  
 ●  Support  proxy  usage  with  reliable  proxy  rotation,  including  both  HTTP  and  SOCKS5  
proxies
 
 ●  Detect  and  respond  to  anti-bot  challenges,  including  HTTP  status  codes  (e.g.,  403),  
CAPTCHA
 
pages,
 
and
 
redirect-based
 
challenges
 
 ●  Manage  cookies  and  HTTP  redirects  similarly  to  a  real  browser  session  
 ●  Implement  timing  randomization  between  requests  to  avoid  behavioral  fingerprinting  
 ●  Avoid  any  use  of  headless  browsers  or  browser  automation  frameworks  (e.g.,  
Puppeteer,
 
Playwright,
 
ChromeDP)
 
 
The  tool  should  be  configurable,  stable  during  continuous  use,  and  provide  minimal  but  clear  
logging
 
of
 
request
 
success,
 
failure,
 
and
 
detection
 
events.
 
 
🔧  Core  Technical  Requirements  
TLS  Fingerprint  Spoofing  
●  Use uTLS or  an  equivalent  for  custom  ClientHello  construction   

--- PAGE 2 ---
●  Support  at  least  3  preset  TLS  profiles  (e.g.,  Chrome,  Firefox,  Safari)  
 ●  Support  randomized  fingerprint  selection  per  request  
 ●  Optional :  Allow  manual  construction  of  a  ClientHello  (custom  cipher  suites,  extensions,  
ALPN,
 
etc.)
 
 ●  Log  or  hash  JA3  fingerprints  per  request  (optional)  
 
 
Proxy  Support  
●  All  requests  must  be  made  through  proxies  
 ●  Proxies  are  provided  in  user:pass@ip:port format  and  can  be  HTTP  or  SOCKS5  
 ●  Implement  proxy  rotation :  
 ○  Rotate  per  request  
 ○  Or  rotate  on  timeout/error/block  
 ●  Validate  proxies  before  use  (optional)  
 
 
Request  Logic  
●  Support  basic  HTTPS  GET  requests  
 ●  Implement  logic  to  detect:  
 ○  Success  (e.g.,  200  OK)  
 ○  Blocks  or  challenges  (403,  CAPTCHA  in  body,  redirects  to  challenge  pages)  
 ●  If  blocked  or  timed  out:  
 ○  Retry  with  a  new  proxy  and  TLS  fingerprint  
 

--- PAGE 3 ---
●  Support  configurable  inputs:  
 ○  Target  URL(s)  
 ○  Proxy  list  
 ○  Number  of  requests  
 ○  TLS  profile/randomization  mode  
 ○  Delay  range  between  requests  
 
 
🛡  Extended  Detection  Evasion  Features  
To  effectively  bypass  layered  detection  systems,  the  following  enhanced  anti-bot  techniques  
must
 
be
 
implemented:
 
Header  Mimicry  
●  Construct  browser-consistent  headers:  
 ○  User-Agent,  Accept,  Accept-Encoding,  Accept-Language,  Sec-CH-UA,  
etc.
 
 ●  Match  headers  to  the  TLS  profile  (e.g.,  Chrome  TLS  +  Chrome  headers)  
 ●  Allow  header  customization  via  config  
 
 
Cookie  Handling  &  Redirects  
●  Maintain  a  simple  cookie  jar  (in-memory,  per  session  or  per  proxy)  
 ●  Optionally  follow  HTTP  redirects  (e.g.,  302s  to  challenge  pages)  
 ●  Support  toggling  cookie  persistence  on/off  
 
 

--- PAGE 4 ---
Challenge  Detection  (Body  Heuristics)  
●  Detect  bot  blocks  or  CAPTCHA  challenges  by  inspecting  response  body  
 ○  Look  for  markers  like  cf-challenge,  g-recaptcha,  verify  you’re  
human,  etc.  
 ●  Categorize  responses  as  Success,  Blocked,  or  Challenged  
 
 
HTTP/2  &  ALPN  Support  
●  Use  HTTP/2  where  negotiated  via  ALPN  
 ●  Allow  fallback  to  HTTP/1.1  if  unsupported  
 ●  Respect  ALPN  negotiation  based  on  TLS  fingerprint  
 
 
JA3  Awareness  
●  Log  or  calculate  JA3  hashes  for  each  request  (optional)  
 ●  Allow  user  to  view  or  configure  known  benign  JA3  profiles  
 
 
Fingerprint  Pools  
●  Maintain  a  rotating  pool  of  TLS+header  fingerprints  
 ●  Randomly  select  from  the  pool  per  request  or  per  session  
 ●  Allow  adding/removing  profiles  via  config  
 
 
Timing  Randomization  

--- PAGE 5 ---
●  Add  jitter/delay  between  requests  to  mimic  human  behavior  
 ●  User-configurable  delay  range  (e.g.,  500ms–3000ms)  
 
 
📦  Implementation  Requirements  
●  Language:  Go  1.20+  
 ●  Tool  can  be  a  CLI  app ,  library ,  daemon ,  or  script  
 ●  Must  handle  at  least  50  consecutive  requests  reliably  
 ○  No  memory  leaks  
 ○  No  crashes  or  hangs  
 ●  Minimal  output/logging  showing:  
 ○  Request  success/failure  
 ○  Blocked/challenged  status  
 ○  Proxy  used  
 ○  (Optional)  TLS  fingerprint  or  JA3  hash  used
